Advantages of LinkedLists:
1. Inserting item into middle of a linked list takes constant time, if you have a reference to the previous node.
2. List can keep growing until the memory runs out.

Disadvantage:
1. Finding the nth item of a linked list takes time proportional to n. Start at the head, walk n-1 nodes.
