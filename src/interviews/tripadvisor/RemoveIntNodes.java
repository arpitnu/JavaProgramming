 *         Given the head node of a singly linked list, where each node contains
 *         a single random character, write an efficient program to remove all
 *         nodes with a numeric character. Assume you have a node data structure
 *         provided for you.
 * 
 *         Example: If you have a linked list “a -> 1 -> b -> 2 -> c” you would
 *         end up with “a -> b -> c”
